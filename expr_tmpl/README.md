# Expression Template

[Expression Template](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_templates) is a common C++ technique used in numerical software. Expressions are evaluated only as needed to produce efficient code for the entire computation. No temporary construct is used in assignments, such as `Vec x = a + b + c;`.
